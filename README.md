Summary:
This memo describes the Donald Trump’s Speech analysis to check on the linguistic effectiveness.

Introduction:
Donald Trump’s three speeches were loaded into the corpus. The data set comprised of basic English. After cleaning the corpus, the top features such as “country”, “immigration”, “people”, “Clinton” shows that his usage of strong words is radically high. This makes a strong impact in spite of usage of the simple language. These high frequency usage of same words will grab the crowd’s attention.

The high frequency bigrams are “hillary_clinton”, “illegal_immigrants”, “president_obama”,” law_enforcement”, “Islamic_terrorism”. Indicates his style of using the rule breaking words like Islamic terrorism, law enforcement and repetitive usage of them shows his exceptional way in making a clear cut point. Also not just that but comparing to previous president Obama and current opponent candidate Hillary Clinton shows that he wants to make a statement that he is different from others and this will be effective towards people who are looking for a change.

Sentiment Analysis of the speeches show that his usage of negative words is more than the positive words. That is 82:32. Usage of negative words like “victim”, “murder”, “crime” shows that he is not being subtle enough to just showcase the positive changes. His high usage of negative words not only indicates he is different, also shows that he wants focus on the negative aspects of the country as well and all together bring in a radical change.

The three speeches are summarized into three topics. The plot shows that first two topics are related and third isn’t. The first two topics describes more about immigration, border, war, Clinton. Where as the last topic talks also about jobs, future and people of country. Even the LDAvis shows that only few of the topics are related and rest are not. It shows that unlike the other candidates, how he doesn’t stick to one topic for long which is a good thing for long speech’s, in order to have the attention of the crowd till the end.

Conclusion:
The analysis indicates that his way of promising changes by repetitive usage of effective and strong words showcases the topics he wants to focus on. Comparing with the previous president and opponent candidate to prove the point that he wants to bring in a radical change. His rule breaking negative words shows the problems of the country he is worried about. The third speech not being so closely related to first two shows that his timing and his inability to stick to same topic for long is a boon. All the above mentioned linguistic factors are the reason behind people being able to connect to him.
